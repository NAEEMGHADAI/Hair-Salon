## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I made this website to be as interactive as possible even though its a static web page but it still didn't stop me from making it interactive. 
A feature which i am very proud of is contact form, it sends email to the owner of the webpage. I used [formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co/) for email feature. 


## Lessons Learned:

I always questioned my ability to create a responsive website on my own before creating this one, but after completing this project, my confidence skyrocketed.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
