## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I made this website to be as interactive as possible even though its a static web page but it still didn't stop me from making it interactive. 
A feature which i am very proud of is contact form, it sends email to the owner of the webpage. I used [formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co/) for email feature. 

## Optimizations

Since my understanding of React at the time I started this project was not very good, I wanted to learn more and add new features where the consumer may make appointments with the salon. I'm currently learning React as well as backend technologies like Node and Express, and I hope to add additional features in the future.

## Lessons Learned:

I always questioned my ability to create a responsive website on my own before creating this one, but after completing this project, my confidence skyrocketed.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
